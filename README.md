# Coding Journey

This repository contains a collection of the projects I created as I’ve been learning to code. Most of these were built after learning a new concept or tackling a coding challenge, and they reflect the progress I’ve made over time. 

Each folder is a standalone project — some are small and based on beginner concepts, others involve APIs, automation, or data structures.

## Projects included

### Python concepts and small challenges
- **Exceptions** – Exploring error handling in Python.
- **Lambda Functions** – Practising the use of anonymous functions.
- **pythonProject1** – General coding practice.
- **Zigzag Python exercises** – A set of Python coding challenges and logic problems.

### API-based projects and automation
- **API Calls** – Testing various APIs and how to make HTTP requests.
- **SendSMS** – Sending automated SMS messages via an API.
- **Weather Alert** – A script that checks weather conditions and alerts the user.

## About this repo

I created this repository to document my progress, keep all my learning projects in one place, and demonstrate how I’ve applied what I’ve learned. I didn’t just follow tutorials — I tried to build or expand projects on my own, often based on challenges or ideas I wanted to explore further.

This is an ongoing learning journey, and I’ll continue to add more as I build new projects.

Thanks for visiting.
